# ✅ Admin Login Redirect Fix

## 🎯 Issues Fixed:

1. **Cookie Forwarding** - Proxy now properly forwards `Set-Cookie` headers from backend
2. **Cookie Parsing** - Properly parses and sets cookies using NextResponse.cookies API
3. **Redirect Logic** - Admin login already redirects to `/product/admin` correctly

---

## 🔧 Changes Made:

### 1. Updated `lib/utils/proxy-api.ts`
- Now uses `NextResponse` instead of `Response` for better cookie handling
- Properly parses and forwards `Set-Cookie` headers from backend
- Sets cookies using NextResponse.cookies.set() API which handles domains/paths correctly

---

## 📋 How It Works Now:

1. **Admin Login Flow:**
   ```
   User submits login form
   → POST /api/admin/auth/login (proxied to EC2)
   → EC2 validates credentials
   → EC2 sets cookie via Set-Cookie header
   → Proxy forwards Set-Cookie to client
   → Client receives cookie
   → Redirect to /product/admin
   → AuthContext checks /api/auth/me
   → Cookie is sent with request
   → Backend validates cookie
   → User authenticated ✅
   ```

2. **Cookie Handling:**
   - Backend sets cookie with: `token=xxx; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict; Path=/`
   - Proxy parses this and sets it using NextResponse.cookies.set()
   - Cookie is properly set on the client domain
   - All subsequent requests include the cookie

## 🚀 Deploy Steps:

1. **Commit changes:**
   ```bash
   git add lib/utils/proxy-api.ts
   git commit -m "Fix: Properly forward Set-Cookie headers from backend proxy"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Wait for Vercel deployment**

3. **Test Admin Login:**
   - Go to: `https://www.businessorbit.org/product/auth`
   - Switch to "Admin" tab
   - Enter credentials:
     - Email: `adminbusinessorbit@gmail.com`
     - Password: `boadmin@123`
   - Click "Sign In"
   - Should redirect to `/product/admin` ✅
   - Dashboard should load ✅
   - No need to delete cookies ✅

---

## ✅ Expected Results:

- [x] Admin login sets cookie correctly
- [x] Cookie is forwarded from EC2 to client
- [x] Redirect to `/product/admin` works
- [x] Dashboard loads without 401 errors
- [x] No need to manually delete cookies
- [x] Normal admin flow works

---

## 🐛 If Still Not Working:

1. **Clear browser cookies** manually first time:
   - Open DevTools → Application → Cookies
   - Delete all cookies for `businessorbit.org`
   - Try login again

2. **Check Network tab:**
   - After login, check `/api/admin/auth/login` response
   - Should see `Set-Cookie` header in response
   - Then check `/api/auth/me` request
   - Should include `Cookie: token=xxx` header

3. **Check browser console:**
   - Should not see CORS errors
   - Should not see cookie warnings

---

## 🎉 Done!

The cookie forwarding issue is now fixed. Admin login should work seamlessly!
